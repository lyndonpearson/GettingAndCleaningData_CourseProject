DATA

The raw data can be located at the following URL:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

and the main reference in processing this data was written by the course TA, David Hood, and is located at the following URL:

https://class.coursera.org/getdata-012/forum/thread?thread_id=9

As stated in Mr. Hood's course project FAQ, the intertial folder was omitted from any processing. Omitting these files meant

that both the "test" and "train" folders consisted of three files-a "subject" file (contain the ID number of the individual

performing the activity), an "X" file (containing the actual data measurements) and a "Y" file (identifying which of the six

activities was being performed at time of measurement).

The three files in both the "test" and "train" folders were jointed together to create a complete training dataset and a complete

test dataset.
